# MyApi

## Overview
MyApi is a web API project built using ASP.NET Core. It provides a structured approach to building a RESTful API with a clear separation of concerns, including controllers, services, repositories, and data models.

## Project Structure
- **Controllers/**: Contains API controllers that handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses.
- **Data/**: Includes configuration for Entity Framework Core and the DbContext.
  - **Migrations/**: Holds files generated for database migrations.
  - **Seed/**: Used for initializing data if necessary.
- **Models/**: Contains data classes or entities (POCOs) used in the application.
- **Repositories/**: Includes repositories for data access.
  - **Interfaces/**: Contains the interfaces for the repositories.
- **Services/**: Holds the business logic of the application.
- **DTOs/**: Contains Data Transfer Objects used for transferring data between layers.
- **Middleware/**: Includes custom middleware components.
- **Utils/**: Contains utility classes or helper functions.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd MyApi
   ```
3. Restore the dependencies:
   ```
   dotnet restore
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

## Usage
